## Problem Solving Strategy
1. For each topic:
   - Start with easier problems (CSES, USACO Bronze/Silver)
   - Move to medium problems (Codeforces DIV2)
   - End with harder problems (IOI practice, USACO Gold/Platinum)
   
2. Time management:
   - Easy problems: 15-20 minutes
   - Medium problems: 30-45 minutes
   - Hard problems: 1-1.5 hours
   
3. If stuck:
   - After 20 minutes: Look for hints
   - After 40 minutes: Read editorial
   - Always implement solution even after reading editorial
