Preparing for both the *International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)* and the *International Olympiad in AI (IOAI)* simultaneously requires a blend of *competitive programming (CP), **data structures and algorithms (DSA), and **AI/ML topics. Here's a **30-day integrated roadmap* that balances *IOI* and *IOAI* preparation effectively:
