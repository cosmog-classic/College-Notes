# Bohr's Atomic Model

## Postulates Of /Bohr's Atomic Model:

- Atoms have a small,heavy and positive particle at their center (Nucleus)
- Electrons in an atom revolve around the nucleus in a circular path called orbit
- As long as electrons don't change their orbit, they neither loose nor gain energy
- Electrons only revolve in those orbits where the integral multiple of h/2pi (here 'h' is [[Planck's constant]]) is equal to it's  angular momentum (Quantization of Angular Momentum) $$\text{i.e. }E  = \frac{h}{2\pi}$$
- Only when an electron jumps from one orbit to another, it gains or looses energy
