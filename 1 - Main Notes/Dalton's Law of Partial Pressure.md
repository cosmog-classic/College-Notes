# Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure

## Law
- Pressures exerted by a certain volume of different two non-reacting gases is equal to the sum of the pressure exerted by them at constant temperature.$$\text{i.e }P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 +P_3+.....+P_n $$
___
## Proof

To prove :
$$n=n_1+n_2+n_3$$
Let, a mixture of 3 non-reacting gasses with V and T as total volume and temperature respectively, n<sub>1</sub>,n<sub>2</sub>,n<sub>3</sub> being moles of gas 1,2,3 respectively,

we know  $$PV = nRT$$$$\text{or, }P  = \frac{nRT}{V}$$
then $$n=n_1+n_2+n_3$$$$\text{Multiplying both sides by} \frac{RT}{V},$$  $$\text{or, }\frac{nRT}{V}=\frac{n_1RT}{V}+\frac{n_2RT}{V}+\frac{n_3RT}{V}$$
$$\text{or, } P=P_1+P_2+P_3$$
