# Rutherford's Scattering Experiment (Nuclear Model)

## Rutherford's Scattering Experiment Diagram:

___

## Observation:

- Majority of the alpha-particles don't get deflected and pass straight through the gold foil
- Some of the alpha-particles get deflected on a small angle
- Least alpha-particles get deflected on a large angle (even 180 degrees)

___

## Conclusion:

- Since majority of the alpha-particles passed straight through the gold foil, we can conclude that most of the space in an atom is empty space.
- Some of the alpha-particles were deflected on a small angle and since alpha-particles are positively charged, we can conclude that some of the volume of an atom is occupied by a positively charged mass.
- Very few alpha-particles were sent back which can only happen in the presence of another heavy positively charged mass (nucleus).
