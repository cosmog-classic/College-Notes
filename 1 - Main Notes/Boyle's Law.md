# Boyle's Law

## Law

-  States that the volume of a gas at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure applied to it.  $$\text{i.e }V \propto \frac{1}{P} $$
*Here **V** is volume and **P** is Pressure*

## (P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> =  P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>) Proof:

Let 'P' be pressure and 'V' be volume of gas at constant temperature, and since we know $$P \propto \frac{1}{V}$$ which implies, $$P=\frac{k}{V} \text{ Where 'k' is proportionality constant}$$ $$PV=k$$
Now we can assume 2 gases with Pressure P<sub>1</sub> & P<sub>2</sub> and volume V<sub>1</sub> & V<sub>2</sub> respectively. 
Since PV is constant at all time on constant temperature,  we can conclude that $$P_1V_1=P_2V_2$$

## Graphical Representation of Boyle's Law:

- In graph A, from the graph of P plotted against V we can conclude that as the pressure decreases the volume of gas increases so we can say that Pressure on a gas is inversely proportional to it's volume. This curve is called hyperbolic curve
- In graph B, from the graph of P plotted against V<sup>-1</sup> we can see the straight line passes through the origin from which we can also conclude that P is inversely proportional to V.
- In graph C, from the graph of PV plotted against P(or V) we get a straight line parallel to the x-axis by which we can conclude that PV is independent of both P and V.
